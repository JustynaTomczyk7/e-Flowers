## General info

"e-Flowers" is an online flower shop that offers bouquets of flowers. This website was created using React.js.
The goal of this project was to gain practical writing skills in React.js.

"e-Flowers" is a single page application, which thanks to React Router has subpages (Main Page, Product Page and Shopping Cart Page).

The entire application is based on React modules and components. Hooks were also used: useState, useEffect and useContext.

After the user leaves the application, added bouquets will not disappear from the basket thanks to LocalStorage.
